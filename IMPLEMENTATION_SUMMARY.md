## Technical Implementation Details

### XP Calculation Formula
```
Base XP = Score × 10
Accuracy Bonus = 50% (perfect) / 25% (excellent) / 10% (good)
Time Bonus = 20% (<30s) / 10% (<60s)
Difficulty Bonus = 15% (advanced) / 25% (expert)
Total XP = (Base XP + Bonuses) × Streak Multiplier
```

### Streak Multipliers
- 1-2 correct: 1.0x
- 3-4 correct: 1.1x
- 5-9 correct: 1.25x
- 10-14 correct: 1.5x
- 15-19 correct: 1.75x
- 20+ correct: 2.0x

### Specialty Proficiency
- **Level Calculation**: `min(10, int(accuracy / 10) + 1)`
- **15 Categories**: Full DSM-5 diagnostic category coverage
- **Real-time Updates**: Proficiency updates after each case

### Clinical Accuracy Scoring
- **Main Diagnosis**: 70% of score
- **Specifiers**: 30% of score (weighted by importance)
- **Partial Credit**: Recognizes similar diagnoses
- **Detailed Feedback**: Explains scoring breakdown

## Data Structures

### Core Classes
```python
@dataclass
class UserProgress:
    # Core progression tracking
    
@dataclass 
class Achievement:
    # Achievement definitions
    
@dataclass
class SpecialtyProficiency:
    # Category-specific skill tracking
    
@dataclass
class StreakData:
    # Streak tracking with multipliers
```

### Serialization Support
- **to_dict() / from_dict()**: Complete state serialization
- **JSON Compatible**: Easy storage and retrieval
- **Backward Compatible**: Handles missing fields gracefully

## Testing Coverage

### Test Files
1. **`test_progression_integration.py`**: End-to-end integration testing

- **Configurable**: Achievement and difficulty definitions externalized
- **Extensible**: Framework supports future enhancements

## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration
```python
# Create progression system
user_progress = UserProgress("user123", "DrSmith")

# Create scoring with progression
scoring = Scoring(scoring_mode=ScoringMode.PARTIAL, user_progress=user_progress)

# Use as before - progression updates automatically
scoring.start_quiz_session(quiz_data)
scoring.record_answer(1, "MDD", 45.0)
stats = scoring.calculate_scores()

# Get progression report
report = scoring.get_session_progression_report()
```

### Clinical Accuracy with Specifiers
```python
specifiers = {
    'with anxious distress': 0.15,
    'moderate': 0.10,
    'recurrent': 0.05
}

score, feedback = scoring.calculate_clinical_accuracy_score(
    "Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress, moderate",
    "Major Depressive Disorder",
    specifiers
)
```
