Create a tool to create multiple choice diagnosis quizzes like this.
ChatGPT said:
Sure, I’ll draft a tool outline that helps you create multiple choice diagnosis quizzes similar to the one in the image. I’ll include the essential components without diving into the prose.


Worked for 3 minutes
Here’s an outline for building a tool that generates multiple‑choice diagnosis quizzes similar to the example you provided. It assumes the tool will handle somatic symptom and related disorders (e.g., somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, functional neurological symptom disorder).

Goal
Develop a program or script that accepts a set of clinical case descriptions and diagnosis categories, then produces formatted multiple‑choice questions where users must match each case to the correct diagnosis.

Essential Components
Data Model
Diagnosis list – A list of possible disorders (e.g., somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, functional neurological symptom disorder). Definitions from trusted sources (e.g., American Psychiatric Association) can help ensure accuracy
psychiatry.org
psychiatry.org
.

Case descriptions – Narratives describing individual patients’ symptoms and behaviours; each case is linked to the correct diagnosis.

Distractors – Additional incorrect diagnoses to populate multiple‑choice options.

Quiz Generator
Input handler – Reads or receives case descriptions and diagnosis options.

Randomizer – Shuffles question order and answer options to reduce pattern recognition.

Formatter – Formats each question with a question number and labeled choices (a, b, c, etc.), and optionally stores the correct answer key for scoring.

Scoring module (optional) – Accepts user responses, compares them with the answer key, and tallies correct answers.

User Interface
Console/CLI – For simple use: display questions and collect responses in a terminal window.

Web interface – Optionally build a small web page using Flask or similar frameworks to display quizzes in a browser.

CSV/JSON input and output – Allow instructors to provide case data in structured files and receive answer keys or results.

Implementation Steps
Define Diagnosis Categories
Create a list or dictionary with the diagnosis names and brief criteria summaries for reference. For example, somatic symptom disorder involves excessive focus on distressing physical symptoms
psychiatry.org
; illness anxiety disorder involves preoccupation with having or getting an illness, usually without significant physical symptoms
psychiatry.org
; functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) features neurological symptoms affecting movement or senses with no medical explanation
mayoclinic.org
.

Collect or Input Cases
Gather case descriptions (e.g., from textbooks or clinical examples). Each case should be stored with its correct diagnosis.

Create a Question Builder Function

Accept a case description and the list of diagnoses.

Randomly order the answer options.

Ensure the correct diagnosis is included among the options.

Assemble the Quiz

Loop through all cases, generating a formatted question for each.

Store the correct option label (e.g., “a”, “b”, “c”) for later scoring.

Output the Quiz

Print to console, write to a text file, or render on a web page.

For self‑grading quizzes, include a way to reveal the answer key after completion.

Add Optional Features

Difficulty settings (vary number of options or include more subtle distractors).

Timer or progress tracking.

Ability to accept new diagnoses and cases through a user interface.

Example Structure (Simplified)
diagnoses = ["somatic symptom disorder", "illness anxiety disorder", "functional neurological symptom disorder"]

cases = [
    {
        "description": "A young adult fixates on physical symptoms like chest pain and headaches, spends excessive time worrying about them, and has seen many doctors despite reassurance.",
        "correct": "somatic symptom disorder"
    },
    {
        "description": "An individual has no significant physical complaints but constantly worries that they have a serious illness, frequently checks for signs of disease, and reads medical reports obsessively.",
        "correct": "illness anxiety disorder"
    },
    ...
]

# Pseudocode for quiz generation
for case in cases:
    shuffled_options = random_shuffle(diagnoses)
    display_question(case['description'], shuffled_options)
    store_answer(case['correct'])
This outline provides a framework for building a customizable multiple‑choice diagnosis quiz generator. You can implement it in Python or another language, and expand it to handle more disorders or a broader range of case studies as needed.

Configurability would be good.  So it's easy to share and add. 
ChatGPT said:

Worked for 8 seconds
Here are a few ways to incorporate configurability so the quiz tool can be easily shared and extended:

External Data Files: Store case descriptions and diagnoses in editable formats such as JSON, CSV, or YAML. This allows anyone to update or add new cases and disorder categories without modifying the code.

Dynamic Loading: Build the program to read these external files at runtime. That way, adding a new category or case only requires editing the data file, and the tool will automatically recognize and include the new entries.

Configurable Options: Allow users to set parameters such as the number of answer choices per question, whether to randomize question order, or whether to include multiple correct answers. These can be passed as command-line arguments, environment variables, or entries in a configuration file.

Modular Design: Separate the quiz logic, data loading, and user interface into distinct modules. For example, one module reads the data files, another generates questions, and a third handles user interaction. This separation makes it straightforward to replace or modify individual parts without affecting the rest.

Exporting: Include functionality to export quizzes and results as shareable formats (e.g., PDF or CSV), or host them via a simple web interface. This way, other users can take or administer the quizzes without needing access to the source code.

This approach ensures that new case studies and diagnostic categories can be added easily, and that the tool remains flexible and maintainable over time.

Building on the configurability aspects, consider these additional details:

Data File Structure

Use a consistent schema for your case descriptions. For example, a JSON file could have an array of objects, where each object contains a case_text, a correct_diagnosis, and optionally a list of categories or tags. This makes it easy to parse and extend.

Example structure:

[
  {
    "case_text": "24-year-old with excessive health-related fears and frequent doctor visits.",
    "correct_diagnosis": "somatic symptom disorder"
  },
  {
    "case_text": "Individual fixated on contracting illnesses despite minimal symptoms.",
    "correct_diagnosis": "illness anxiety disorder"
  }
]
Pluggable Content Modules

Create separate files for categories or topics. For instance, one module might cover somatic symptom and related disorders (drawing on definitions like those from the DSM-5
psychiatry.org
psychiatry.org
), while another might cover mood disorders.

At runtime, the quiz generator can load any module specified by the user. This reduces duplication and allows others to develop their own modules.

User Configuration

Accept a configuration file or command-line flags to adjust settings. Examples include:

--file=path/to/data.json to specify the question set.

--num-choices=4 to choose how many options per question.

--shuffle=true or --shuffle=false to control randomization.

You can also define default values so the tool works even if no configuration is provided.

Editing Interface

For broader accessibility, provide a simple form-based web interface or GUI (e.g., built with Tkinter, Electron, or a lightweight web framework). This allows users without programming experience to add or modify cases and categories.

You might let users import or export their quizzes via the interface in the chosen structured format.

Sharing and Version Control

Encourage sharing via version control systems like GitHub or GitLab. Users can fork or clone the repository and add their own case files.

Maintain documentation that explains how to contribute new cases and categories, the expected file structure, and guidelines for writing clear case descriptions.

Localization and Accessibility

If the tool will be used in different regions or languages, design the data files to separate content from logic so translations can be added easily.

Follow accessibility guidelines (e.g., labeling fields, supporting screen readers) in any user interface.

By adopting these practices, the tool becomes flexible, extensible, and accessible to a wide audience. Users can tailor it to various topics or languages while maintaining a consistent and manageable core.

Create datasets across categories of the dsm 5 tr.

Then allow configuration to specify combinations of dataset and categories. There's should be a category for all disorders. 
ChatGPT said:
To proceed with creating DSM-5-TR datasets, could you clarify the following:

What level of detail should each disorder include? For example:

Diagnostic criteria

Common symptoms

Case vignettes/examples

ICD/DSM codes

Should the datasets include:

Just adult presentations?

Or also child/adolescent and geriatric variants?

What format do you prefer for the datasets? (e.g., JSON, CSV, YAML)

Are you looking for summaries suitable for quizzes, educational study, or clinical reference?

Once I have this, I’ll create structured datasets by DSM-5-TR category, and include a master list that allows selection by category or full inclusion.

ChatGPT said:
Got it. I’ll begin compiling DSM-5-TR-aligned case studies—covering both adult and pediatric presentations—with clinical language, narrative detail, and mental status examinations (MSEs), organized by diagnostic category.

Each case will be structured in JSON format and include a field for diagnosis, age group, category, and configurable metadata for quiz generation.

I’ll let you know once the dataset is ready for review.

DSM-5-TR Case Study Dataset in JSON Format

DSM-5-TR Case Studies Dataset (JSON Format)
The following JSON dataset contains detailed clinical case studies for disorders spanning all major diagnostic categories of the DSM-5-TR. In DSM-5-TR, mental disorders are organized into broad categories (e.g. Neurodevelopmental Disorders, Depressive Disorders, Anxiety Disorders, etc.) that reflect similarities in symptoms and typical age of onset
psychiatry.org
psychiatry.org
. Each entry in the dataset is a self-contained case vignette designed for diagnostic reasoning practice, and includes:
Narrative: A clinical history and presentation of the patient’s symptoms (in professional clinical language).
MSE: A Mental Status Examination detailing the patient’s appearance, behavior, mood/affect, thought process/content, perception, cognition, insight, and judgment as observed.
Diagnosis: The correct DSM-5-TR diagnosis for the case.
Age_group: Flag indicating whether the case is an adult or child/adolescent presentation.
Category: The DSM-5-TR diagnostic category of the disorder (for filtering by content area).
Complexity: A relative difficulty level of the case (e.g. “easy”, “moderate”, “high”) to support quiz configuration.
Each case is represented as a JSON object. The cases cover a diverse range of ages (children, adolescents, adults, and an older adult) and presentations, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for creating multiple-choice diagnostic quizzes. The dataset structure is extendable, so additional cases can be added following the same format.

Judgment appears sound as he is following through with recommended evaluations and therapy.",

    "narrative": "A 16-year-old assigned male at birth presents to a gender identity clinic with his parents. From a young age, the patient has insisted that he is actually a girl. In childhood, he preferred to play with dolls and dress in girls’ clothing. Now, with the onset of puberty, he has become increasingly distressed by the development of male secondary sex characteristics. He reports feeling disgusted by his facial hair and deepening voice, and he often tapes his chest to create the appearance of breasts. He experiences significant anxiety and depression related to the mismatch between his experienced gender (female) and his body. His parents are supportive but concerned about his well-being.",
    "MSE": "The patient is a 16-year-old youth, dressed in gender-neutral clothing. He appears anxious and somewhat sad during the interview, though he is cooperative. Speech is soft and hesitant at first but becomes more fluent as he becomes comfortable. Mood is 'depressed and anxious,' and affect is congruent, with tearfulness when discussing body changes. Thought processes are coherent and goal-directed. Thought content centers on strong identification as female and significant distress about having a male body. He denies any hallucinations or delusions. He admits to occasional passive wishes to not wake up but denies active suicidal intent or plan. He is fully oriented and cognitively intact. Insight is good regarding his gender identity (he is clear about feeling female), and he is aware that transitioning is a complex process. Judgment appears appropriate; he has sought therapy and medical consultation with family support.",

    "narrative": "A 15-year-old male is brought to a juvenile justice evaluation after multiple encounters with law enforcement. Over the past two years, he has been involved in physical fights at school and was expelled for assaulting a classmate. He has also been caught shoplifting and was recently accused of breaking into a neighbor's garage. His parents report long-standing behavioral issues, including chronic lying and skipping school. They describe him as having little remorse when he hurts others or gets into trouble. There is a history of cruelty to the family pet, and he appears to get a 'thrill' from intimidating younger children. No evidence of an underlying medical condition is present, and substance use has been denied.",
    "MSE": "The patient is an adolescent male who appears his stated age, dressed in casual clothing. He slouches in his chair with an attitude of indifference. He makes intermittent eye contact, often with a defiant stare. Speech is normal in rate and volume but his tone is curt. When asked about his behavior, his mood is described as 'fine,' and affect is mostly flat, though he smirks when recalling some aggressive acts. Thought process is coherent and concrete. Thought content is notable for a lack of concern for others; he denies feeling guilty about his actions and does not appear to have internalized a sense of wrongdoing. He denies suicidal or homicidal ideation when asked directly, though his history suggests a propensity for violence. He is oriented to person, place, and time. His insight is minimal—he does not acknowledge a problem with his behavior. Judgment is significantly impaired as evidenced by repeated involvement in illegal and aggressive activities.",

    "narrative": "A 28-year-old female is seen in an addiction clinic seeking help for opioid use. She reports that two years ago she was prescribed oxycodone after a dental surgery and found that it helped not only her pain but also made her feel relaxed and euphoric. Over time, she began taking more than prescribed and when her prescriptions ran out, she started buying pills illegally. For the past six months, she has been snorting heroin daily because it became cheaper and easier to obtain. She has tried to quit on her own but developed intense withdrawal symptoms (nausea, muscle aches, diarrhea, anxiety) each time, leading her to relapse. She has lost her job due to frequent absences and is estranged from her family because she stole money to buy drugs. She is motivated to quit and seek treatment.",
    "MSE": "The patient is a thin woman who appears slightly disheveled. She has visible track marks on her forearms. She is cooperative but becomes teary when discussing her addiction. Speech is generally clear, though her voice trembles when she expresses regret. Her mood is 'ashamed and anxious,' and affect is congruent, with evident sadness. Thought processes are goal-directed and coherent. Thought content is focused on her desire to quit opioids and guilt over her past actions; there are no delusions or hallucinations reported. She denies suicidal ideation, stating she wants to live and get better. She is fully oriented, and her cognition appears intact. Insight is good regarding her addiction—she acknowledges the problem and the need for help. Judgment has been impaired in the context of her substance use (e.g., theft and continued use despite consequences), but currently, she demonstrates improving judgment by seeking treatment.",

Over the last 2 years, she has had increasing difficulty remembering recent events and often repeats the same questions. She recently got lost while driving to a familiar grocery store. At home, she sometimes forgets to turn off the stove. Her family notes changes in her personality; she has become more apathetic and occasionally irritable, whereas she was previously very lively. There have been no hallucinations or delusional beliefs. Her medical history is unremarkable aside from well-controlled diabetes. No evidence of stroke is present, and an MRI showed generalized cortical atrophy consistent with age.",
    "MSE": "The patient is an older woman who appears stated age, with clean casual attire. She is pleasant and cooperative. Speech is normal in rate and tone but she occasionally loses her train of thought. Her mood is generally calm, and affect is appropriate though somewhat shallow. She is able to engage in casual conversation, but when questioned on specifics, she struggles to recall recent events (e.g., what she had for breakfast or recent news). Thought process is generally linear but becomes tangential when she tries to cover memory gaps. No hallucinations or paranoia are observed during the interview. She is oriented to person and place, but only partially to time (she is off by the month and unsure of the exact date). Her short-term memory is significantly impaired (unable to remember three objects after five minutes), whereas long-term memory for childhood events is relatively preserved. Insight is limited; she acknowledges 'some memory trouble' but does not grasp its severity. Judgment in complex tasks (like managing finances or driving) is impaired, as evidenced by her recent difficulties and the need for family oversight.",

She reports intense, unstable relationships; she often idolizes new friends or romantic partners, then suddenly feels betrayed or abandoned over minor misunderstandings. She describes chronic feelings of emptiness and has a volatile self-image that shifts between feeling okay and hating herself. Her mood fluctuates markedly throughout the day, with episodes of intense irritability, anxiety, or despair that last a few hours. Under stress, particularly after an argument with her boyfriend, she has engaged in impulsive self-harm by cutting her forearm, and has made two past suicide attempts in what she describes as moments of feeling unbearable pain and fear of abandonment. She has no psychotic symptoms outside of transient, stress-related paranoia. She denies current substance abuse.",
    "MSE": "The patient is a casually dressed young woman who appears her stated age. She is visibly distressed, frequently tearing up during the interview. She makes good eye contact and is cooperative. Speech is fluent and generally normal, though at times she raises her voice emotionally when describing conflicts. Her mood is 'very up and down,' and affect is labile, shifting from tearful to tense anger and back within the session. Thought process is generally coherent but circumstantial when discussing emotional events. Thought content reveals deep fears of abandonment and feelings of emptiness. There are no fixed delusions or hallucinations, though she acknowledges that when extremely stressed she sometimes 'dissociates' or becomes paranoid briefly. She denies current suicidal ideation but admits to frequent urges to self-harm when upset. She is oriented in all spheres and cognitively intact. Insight is limited regarding her relational patterns—she feels others cause the turmoil but acknowledges she has 'overreactions.' Judgment is variable; she can identify negative behaviors in hindsight, yet in the heat of the moment she struggles to control her impulsive actions.",

Over the past year, he has had recurrent urges to expose his genitals to unsuspecting strangers in public places, which he has acted on several times. He reports feeling a strong surge of sexual excitement during these incidents. He admits to planning these acts, such as choosing locations where he is likely to find an unsuspecting female observer. After each incident, he experiences shame and vows not to do it again, but finds the urges overwhelming. He has no history of psychosis or substance use, and he maintains steady employment, though this behavior has caused significant strain in his personal life and legal consequences.",

He is cooperative with the evaluation, though he becomes visibly uncomfortable when discussing the details of his charges. His speech is soft and somewhat hesitant when describing sensitive information. His mood is 'ashamed and anxious,' and affect is remorseful, with occasional nervous laughter. Thought processes are goal-directed. Thought content reveals persistent sexual preoccupation with exposing himself, which he recognizes as problematic but struggles to resist. He denies any delusions or hallucinations. No suicidal or homicidal ideation is present. He is oriented and has intact cognition. Insight is partial; he understands that the behavior is wrong and has legal repercussions, but he has difficulty controlling the impulses. Judgment is impaired in that he continues to engage in behavior that has led to legal trouble, despite knowing the potential consequences.",
