She reports that two years ago she was prescribed oxycodone after a dental surgery and found that it helped not only her pain but also made her feel relaxed and euphoric. Over time, she began taking more than prescribed and when her prescriptions ran out, she started buying pills illegally. For the past six months, she has been snorting heroin daily because it became cheaper and easier to obtain. She has tried to quit on her own but developed intense withdrawal symptoms (nausea, muscle aches, diarrhea, anxiety) each time, leading her to relapse. She has lost her job due to frequent absences and is estranged from her family because she stole money to buy drugs. She is motivated to quit and seek treatment.",

Insight is good regarding her addiction\u2014she acknowledges the problem and the need for help.
